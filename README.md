## 1. Exponentiation Calculator
A serverless web application that computes mathematical exponentiation of a base and its exponent.

### Services Used: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Amplify and IAM.

#### Highlights:
- Fully serverless architecture for cost efficiency and scalability.
- API Gateway enables seamless communication between frontend and backend.
- DynamoDB stores computation results with timestamps for future reference.
- AWS Amplify manages frontend deployment and hosting.
- IAM policies ensure secure access to resources.
This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a serverless application for a mathematical use case while leveraging AWS services for backend computation, storage, and security.
